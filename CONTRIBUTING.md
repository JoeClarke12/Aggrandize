## **Bug reports**

--

A bug is a demonstrable problem that is caused by the code in the repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful, so thanks!

Guidelines for bug reports:

- Validate and lint your code — Ensure your problem isn't caused by a simple error in your own code.

- Use the GitHub issue search — check if the issue has already been reported.

- Check if the issue has been fixed — try to reproduce it using the latest master or development branch in the repository.

- Isolate the problem — ideally create a reduced test case and a live example.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What OS experience the problem? What would you expect to be the outcome? All these details will help people to fix any potential bugs.


Example:

Short and descriptive example bug report title

A summary of the issue and the OS environment in which it occurs. If suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.

- This is the first step
- This is the second step
- Further steps, etc.
- <url> - a link to the reduced test case

Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their merits).
